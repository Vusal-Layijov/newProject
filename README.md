Create a README

Great projects should always be accompanied by great READMEs! For this project, your README will document the API that you are implementing.

On your system, create a directory for your new project. Within this directory, copy over the framework of the API documentation for your chosen application. This document should be the README.md file at the root of the project directory. By implementing this naming convention, GitHub will utilize this file to be displayed on the main page of your repository.

With your project directory and README created, initialize your local git repository, add and commit the contents, and add the GitHub remote as the origin before pushing. Remember that GitHub outlines these steps for you on the repo's page if you have not yet pushed any commits.

After pushing to GitHub, the README should now be rendered when navigating to the repository page.# newProject
